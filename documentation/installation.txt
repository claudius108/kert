kert relies on jquery and Datatables.

A. Installation of kert:
1. Install jquery and set path in kert.html.
2. Install Datatables (http://datatables.net) and set path in kert.html.
3. Use packed index.xml as model for definition of tests.

The package also includes proxy.php, needed for cross domain requests (this file is just as example;
for more sophisticated proxy uses, set your own solution).
